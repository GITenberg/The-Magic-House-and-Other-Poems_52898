<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">Come</span> hither, Care, and look on this fair place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But leave your gossip and your puckered face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond that flowering carrot in the glow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the red poppies in the orchard blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And come with gentle feet; the last thing there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was a white butterfly upon the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And even now a thrush was in the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feel the sovereign water slowly pass.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This pool is quiet as oblivion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hidden securely from the flooding sun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its crystal placid surface here receives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wan grey under light of the willow leaves;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shy things brood about the grass unheard;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only in sunny distance sings the bird.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O Time long dead, O days reclaimed and done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou broughtest joy and tears to every one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here by this deep pool thou wast not slow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To deal a maiden all her tender woe;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_88" id="page_88"></a>{88}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be kindlier to her now that she is dead,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let her charmed spirit visit this well-head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More often, for at eve in honey-time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Drifting in silence from her ghostly clime,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She haunts the pool about the willows pale:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be gentle, for my feeling art may fail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I’ll freshen sorrow and retell her tale.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She was a fragile daughter of the earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And touched with faery from her fatal birth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many summers she was hardly shy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not clouded with her hovering destiny,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But only wild as any woodland thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That comes at even to a trodden spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scarce she seemed of any settled mood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That lights the peaceful hills of maidenhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But shifted strangely on the whimsy air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not quiet nor contented anywhere.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gathered sunshine in an earthen cruse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought to keep it for her own sweet use;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or fluttered flowers from her window high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wept upon them when they would not fly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when she found the brownish mignonette<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had blossomed where a little seed was set,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_89" id="page_89"></a>{89}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She planted her rag playmate in the sun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because she wanted yet another one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when she heard the enraptured sparrow sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She clamoured for a song from everything.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For many years she was as strange and free,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a pine linnet in a cedar tree.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her folk thought: She is very wild and odd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she is good, we’ll wait and trust in God.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O love, that watched the weird and charméd child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Change from her airy fancies sweet and mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like a blue brook that clears a meadow spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And threads the barley where the bobolinks sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then wimples by the roots of dusky firs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gathers darkness in those deeps of hers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then makes an arrowy movement through a pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where rocks are crannied with the clinging grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then falls, almost dissolved in silver rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gathers deeply to a pool again;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But something wild in her new spirit lies,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She never can regain her limpid eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">O love, alas! ’twas ever so to be,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When streams set out to reach the bitter sea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a time within the early spring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the orchards had done blossoming,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_90" id="page_90"></a>{90}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the kinglet on his northern search,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had ceased his timorous piping in the birch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When streams were bright before the coming leaves<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gurgled like the swallows in the eaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wandered led by fancy to this place,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And looked upon the water’s crystal face;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw&mdash;what thing of beauty or of awe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know not, no one knoweth what she saw.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ever after she was constant here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As silent as her shadow in the mere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sitting upon a stone which many feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had grooved and trodden for the water sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And leaning gravely on her slanted arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fingers buried in the gravel warm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gazed and gazed and did not speak or sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if this gazing was her destiny.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They led her nightly from the magic pool,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the shadows grew too deep and cool;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They thought to win her from the liquid spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tried to tease the elfin maid to tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was the charm that led her to the spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all their words availed not anything.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then gazed they on the surface of the pool<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To read the reason of such subtle rule;<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_91" id="page_91"></a>{91}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their eyes were overclouded, they could see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Who had drawn water there perpetually)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing but water in a depth serene,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a few moony stones of palish green.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They thought perchance it was her face she saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And answered, beauty unto beauty’s law,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when they showed her image in a glass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was not cured and nothing came to pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So then they left her to her own strange will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And here she stayed when the fair pool was still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the wind would hurl the heavy rain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She peered out sadly from her window-pane;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when the night set wildly close and deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She took her trouble down the dale of sleep:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when the night was warm and no dew fell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She waked and dreamed beside the starlit well.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then came a change, each day some offering<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She laid beside the clear soft flowing spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there she found them at the break of morn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And everything would take away forlorn;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until beside the unconscious spring was laid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each treasure held most precious by a maid.<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_92" id="page_92"></a>{92}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">After, she offered flowers and often set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A bowlful of the pleasant mignonette,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And starred the stones with the narcissus white,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pansies left athinking all the night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then ruffled dewy dahlias, and at last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When sundown told the summer-time had passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stainéd asters; but from day to day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sadly she took the untouched flowers away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With autumn and the sounding harvest flute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She brought her timid god the heavy fruit;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But found it still and cool at early dawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beaded with dew upon the crispy lawn.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last one eve she placed an apple here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Smooth as a topaz and as golden clear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scented like almonds, with a flesh like dew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And luscious-sweet as honey through and through.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She left it sadly on the sleepy lawn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when she came again her apple gold was gone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Day after day for days she mutely strove,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not to be separate from her placid love;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perchance she thought that, breaking through the spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her shadow-god, deep in the tranquil well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_93" id="page_93"></a>{93}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had taken her last gift;&mdash;no man may know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fancies merged with all mute things that go<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The poppied path, dreams and desires foredone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The unplucked roses of oblivion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now she searched for words that would express<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something of all her spirit’s loneliness;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And formed a liquid jargon, full of falls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As weird and wild as ariel madrigals;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our human tongue was far too harsh for this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or her slight spirit bore too great a bliss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But always grew she very faint and pale,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Day after day her beauty grew more frail,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More mute, more eerie, more ethereal;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her soul burned whitely in its waning shell.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then came the winter with his frosty breath<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And made the world an image of white death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And like to death he found the charméd child;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet could not kill her with his bluster wild.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only in his first days she went about,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sadly hearkened to his hearty shout;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From windows where the wizard frost had traced<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moth-wings of rime with silver ferns inlaced,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_94" id="page_94"></a>{94}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">She saw her pool set coldly in the drift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where in the autumn she had left her gift,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Capped with a cloud of silver steam or smoke,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That hovered there whether she dreamed or woke;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And often stealing from her early sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She watched the light cloud in the midnight deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Waver and blow beneath the moon’s white globe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shivering and whispering in her chilly robe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At last she would not look or speak at all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned her large eyes to the shaded wall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now she is dead, they thought; but never so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She died not when the winter winds did blow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was a spirit of the summer air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would not vanish at the year’s despair.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">At length the merry sun grew warm and high,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And changed the wildwood with his alchemy;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The violet reared her bell of drooping gold,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And over her the robin chimed and trolled.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the first slender moon of May had come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That finds the blithe bird busy at his home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They missed the spirit maiden from the room,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That now was sweet with light and spring perfume,<span class="pagenum"><a name="page_95" id="page_95"></a>{95}</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And called her all the echoing afternoon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She answered not, but when the growing moon<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went down the west with the last bird awing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They found her dead beside her darling spring.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">This is her tale, her murmurous monument<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Flows softly where her fragile life was spent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not grooved in brass nor trenched in pallid stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But told by water to the reeds alone.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">She cometh here sometimes on summer eves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her quiet spirit lingers in the leaves,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And while this spring flows on, and while the wands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sway in the moonlight, while in drifting bands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The thistledown blows gleaming in the air,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dappled thrushes haunt the precinct fair;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She will return, she will return and lean<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Above the crystal in the covert green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dream of beauty on the shadow flung<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of irised distance when the world was young.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Let us be gone; this is no place for tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us go slowly with the guardian years;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let us be brave, the day is almost done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Another setting of the pleasant sun.<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>This important work is written by Mr. Collingwood, who has been for
some years Mr. Ruskin’s private secretary, and who has had unique
advantages in obtaining materials for this book from Mr. Ruskin
himself and from his friends. It contains a large amount of new
matter, and of letters which have never been published, and is, in
fact, as near as is possible at present, a full and authoritative
biography of Mr. Ruskin. The book contains numerous portraits of
Mr. Ruskin, including a coloured one from a water-colour portrait
by himself, and also 13 sketches, never before published, by Mr.
Ruskin and Mr. Arthur Severn. A bibliography is added.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘No more magnificent volumes have been published for a long time
than “The Life and Work of John Ruskin.” In binding, paper,
printing, and illustrations they will satisfy the most fastidious.
They will be prized not only by the band of devotees who look up to
Mr. Ruskin as the teacher of the age, but by the many whom no
eccentricities can blind to his genius....’&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>‘It is just because there are so many books about Mr. Ruskin that
these extra ones are needed. They survey all the others, and
supersede most of them, and they give us the great writer as a
whole.... He has given us everything needful&mdash;a biography, a
systematic account of his writings, and a bibliography.... This
most lovingly written and most profoundly interesting
book.’&mdash;<i>Daily News.</i></p>

<p>‘The record is one which is well worth telling; the more so as Mr.
Collingwood knows more about his subject than the rest of the
world.... His two volumes are fitted with elaborate indices and
tables, which will one day be of immense use to the students of
Ruskin’s work.... It is a book which will be very widely and
deservedly read.’&mdash;<i>St. James’s Gazette.</i></p>

<p>‘To a large number of people these volumes will be more
pre-eminently the book of the year than any other that has been, or
is likely to be, published.... It is long since we have had a
biography with such varied delights of substance and of form. Such
a book is a pleasure for the day, and a joy for ever.’&mdash;<i>Daily
Chronicle.</i></p>

<p>‘It is not likely that much will require to be added to this record
of his career which has come from the pen of Mr. W. G. Collingwood.
Mr. Ruskin could not well have been more fortunate in his
biographer.’&mdash;<i>Globe.</i></p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>‘Mr. Kipling’s verse is strong, vivid, lull of character....
Unmistakable genius rings in every line.’&mdash;<i>Times.</i></p>

<p>‘The disreputable lingo of Cockayne is henceforth justified before
the world; for a man of genius has taken it in hand, and has shown,
beyond all cavilling, that in its way it also is a medium for
literature. You are grateful, and you say to yourself, half in envy

<p>‘<span class="lftspc">“</span>Barrack-Room Ballads” contains some of the best work that Mr.
Kipling has ever done, which is saying a good deal. “Fuzzy-Wuzzy,”
“Gunga Din,” and “Tommy,” are, in our opinion, altogether superior
to anything of the kind that English literature has hitherto
produced.’&mdash;<i>Athenæum.</i></p>

<p>‘These ballads are as wonderful in their descriptive power as they
are vigorous in their dramatic force. There are few ballads in the
English language more stirring than “The Ballad of East and West,”
worthy to stand by the Border ballads of Scott.’&mdash;<i>Spectator.</i></p>

<p>‘The ballads teem with imagination, they palpitate with emotion. We

the cunningly ordered words tingle with life; and if this be not
poetry, what is?’&mdash;<i>Pall Mall Gazette.</i></p></div>

material from the Google Books project.)


Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
